          I’m a woman born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden and has erlier worked
          in the hotel industry as both Front desk manager but also as system
          responisble for the booking system withing the hotel chain. I have
          always been interested in tech, and that’s how I found more
          information about coding. It got my attention and after some back and
          forth, I finally applied for this Frontend developer program at Hyper
          Island, and got in! I'm in the middle of the propgram, and are
          expected to graduate in April 2022. In October 2021 I will do a 24
          weeks long internship. Contact me if you are interested in having me
          in your company! I'm eager to learn and good at seeking information
          online.
