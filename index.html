            I’m a woman born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden and has earlier
            worked in the hotel industry as both Front desk manager but also as
            system responsible for the booking system within the hotel chain. I
            have always been interested in tech, and that’s how I found more
            information about coding. It got my attention and after some back
            and forth, I finally applied for this Frontend developer program at
            Hyper Island, and got in! I'm in the middle of the program, and are
            expected to graduate in April 2022. In October 2021 I will do a 24
            weeks long internship. Contact me if you are interested in having me
            in your company! I'm eager to learn and good at seeking information
            online.

              <h3>What was the brief?</h3>
              <p>
                The brief was to create a personal text-based webpage with the
                help of HTML and CSS. Side quest was to include an image or
                background patter, video, sound etc. Also to add a subpage from
                the main page.
              </p>
              <h3>What did I learned?</h3>
              <p>
                I have learned a lot about buttons and links during this
                project. Also worked a lot with positioning, playing with grid
                and float property and position property.

              <h3>What was the brief?</h3>
              <p>
                The brief was to make an interactive page using JavaScript, HTML
                and CSS. We had several options to choose from, but I decided to
                create a game. The plan was to create a Tic-tac-toe but I knew
                nothing about JavaScript, and after a week had gone I felt like
                I hade learned nothing and had so long way left to go, not only
                in JS but also with CSS and HTML. I felt like all I could create
                was a button. And from that thought, this Revers Psychology game
                came to life.
              </p>
              <h3>What did I learned?</h3>
              <p>
                I have learned how to make an object move randomly within a
                container with the help of JavaScript. I also made a timer to go
                down and to check conditions that executes code if certain
                requirements are met. It was really fun and also encouraging
                that I created it all from my own thought and what I had learned
                the passed days.

              <h3>What was the brief?</h3>
              <p>
                This was a group project, and the brief was to build a habit
                tracker using vanilla JavaScript. The goal was to learn how to
                organize projects and break down tasks, Learn how to work with
                code in groups, and finally learn how to work with git.
              </p>
              <h3>What did I learned?</h3>
              <p>
                I have learned a lot this brief! I learned about how GitHub
                works, both in the browser, in the command prompt, GitHub app
                and also in VS code! I find it a very useful tool and
                interesting to work with. I also understood more how working
                with the same code in a group works, which was an eye opening
                because it's kind of a question mark before this brief.

                  Here is some text regarding what I have learned during my
                  first project. I know that this is not good to write in the
                  HTML but right now this is what I know. I don't have a
                  database and I missed the LocalStorage learning really, so
                  this is what I can accomplish in this short time. Just writing
                  some mote text to see where it goes yes its filling up.
