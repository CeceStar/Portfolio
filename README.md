# First portfolio I created (old) (Brief 2 * Fundamentals - Interactive data*)
This is my portfolio page. It was my first portfolio page that I created which was a school project. When deciding to make a new one, I wanted to keep this one as it is since it shows a part of my process of where I started of. Therefor I have created a Portfolio 2.0 instead which is a react app.

This is written in vanilla javascript autum 2020. I had not studies coding so long, and this was my second javascript project I've made.
