# First portfolio I created
### (Brief 4 *If this then that - Responsive and accessible page with one or more external libraries*)

For this Brief I decided to make a portfolio page. This is written in vanilla javascript autum 2020. I had not studied coding so long, and this was my third javascript project I've made.

I have started on a new Portfolio page, but I wanted to keep this one instead of editing it, since it shows a part of my process of where I started of. You can check out my new one here: https://cecilia-hallerby.web.app/
